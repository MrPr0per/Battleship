- The goal of this article is to fake a chat packet.

- The process of packet reversing begins with analyzing them.

- By comparing several different packets, we can understand that the data is not stored in plain text.

- It can be assumed that the data is somehow compressed.

- Since the game works on both Windows and Linux, we can assume that a popular archiver, common to both systems, is used.

- After trying out several archivers, we notice that the packets and files compressed with gzip have common header bytes.

- If we try to unpack a packet using gzip, we will see human-readable data in the form of plain text - this is a success!

- Now, if we compress our own data using gzip and send it as a packet, we can see that our message appears in the game's chat.

- As a result, we have the ability to send messages in the chat bypassing the official game client.

- In conclusion, it can be said that reversing and modifying packets is quite simple and anyone can do it.
